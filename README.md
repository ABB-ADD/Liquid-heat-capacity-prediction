# Liquid-heat-capacity-prediction
Developing multiple machine learning-based models to predict heat capacity of liquid organic compounds 
Four machine learning (ML) algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), and Ridge Regression (RR), were selected to develop predictive model for heat capacity of liquid compound. The heat capacity at a specified temperature can be predicted by providing the substance's SDF file and temperature.
